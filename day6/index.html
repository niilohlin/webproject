    <div class="title">Linux as IDE</div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments. Like Eclipse, or 
      Code Blocks, are used to make programming easier. IDEs are basicly
      a big, fancy editor that has built in compiler and debugger. But what
      are the benefits of not using an IDE? Here is a short list of tools that
      I could not see myself programming without.</p>

      <p><b>Linux. </b>If you are not using an IDE you are preferably using a
      Unix system like linux. Because there is hundreds of small commands that
      replace all the functionality of an IDE. For example <tt>find</tt>
      or <tt>grep</tt>.</p>

      <p><b>Zsh. </b>The default shell for linux is bash. but i would recommend
      zsh. As it has better auto completition.</p>

      <p><b>Tmux. </b>The terminal multiplexer is awesome if you are a keyboard
      guy. It makes it possible to have multiple terminal instances open side
      by side in one terminal window</p> 

      <p><b>Vim.</b> Your editor is a subject to preference (tip, all items
      in this list are). It doesn't really matter wich editor you choose. But
      the important part is that you are comfortable using it and that you can
      use it without moving your hand to the mouse and preferaby to the arrow
      keys. If you are a Vim user, then you can move around in your code 
      without leaving the home row</p>
      
      <p><b>Git.</b> Even if you only code alone is git an awesome tool for 
      programming. If you use Github then your code becomes syncronized across
      your mashines. And git eases backups. So you dont need to have a 
      <tt>myproject.bak</tt> file and manually back it up everytime you want to 
      snapshot your progress</p>

      <p><b>Urxvt.</b> Is an awesome terminal emulator where you can change
      every concevable preference. It is extendable by perl</p>
      
      <p><b>Dvorak.</b> Preferably Programmer Dvorak or anything else than
      QWERTY. You can use colemak or workman. It doesn't matter really.
      The thing with programmer dvorak is that you have to  hit Shift to get
      the numerical keys. And thats good. Because you aren't suppose to hard 
      code your variables anyway. And a programmer layout brings the special
      characters closer to your hand.</p>
